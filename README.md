# standalone user/password dialog

![getcredentials](getcredentials.png)

This project was created to replace a [Get-Credential](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-credential?view=powershell-7) cmdlet in a script in order to have more customization options (see features below). It will print the user name to stdout and the password to stderr.

## Features

Use the `--help` commandline option to show the help screen:
